## [v1.12.1](https://bifrost-front-end-library-git-v1-12-1-bifrost-vui.vercel.app/) - _2023-08-15_

see [github-release](https://github.com/bifrost-vui/bifrost-front-end-library/releases/tag/v1.12.1)

### Breaking Changes

-   None

### Bugs fixes

#### JavaScript / Bootstrap

-   In the development of the `real tab functionality` in the last release, in the JS file there was a
    `import 'bootstrap';` used for the functionality. Since this import was also done in another file elsewhere,
    it caused other Bootstrap JavaScript functionalities to being called twice when triggered. For example,
    for `Block Selection` on mobile resolution it can be collapse like an accordion. But with this issue,
    it was not closing. Fixing this issue fixes that bug and probably others not found yet.

-   Adjust API documentation.
-   Add an internal API page.

    -   It is kept in the code for legacy purpose.
-   Add custom background color and font color functionalities.
    -   Add `customBgColor` and `customFontColor` props.
    -   Adjust CSS for the hero to take the new custom colors.

### Breaking Changes

-   None

### Bugs fixes

-   None

### Special mentions

-   Add a `_reversed` global prop in Storybook to simulate a component is a "reversed" mode.
    The prop exists on some components as `reversed`, but for a lot of these components it
    is not really used by the component, so it made more sense to transform it as a global prop.
-   Add a new SASS function: `calculateRem`. It is useful when you only have a value in `px` and
    you want the value to be rendered in `rem`.
-   Adjust global CSS for `font-size`.

    -   Add a table to show which props is available for each card type.
    -   Adjust documentation uses of `Badge`, `Button` and `IInputIncrement` APIs.
-   Add an internal API page.

-   They can be displayed in three sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`.

### Breaking Changes

### Bugs fixes

#### `|default(true)` issues

When a boolean `false` value comes from PHP and is passed to a prop in a Twig `include`, this value is considered as being `not defined` or `empty`.
So, for components that had a variable with a `|default(true)` filter, when the value `false` was passed, it always returned `true` because of the filter.
The fix is documented in the updated [Boolean variable](?path=/docs/coding-standards--page#boolean-variable) in Coding Standards docs.
The list of components fixed are:

-   [Block Highlight](?path=/story/components-block-highlight--drupal)
-   [Link](?path=/story/components-link--drupal)
-   [Price](?path=/story/components-price--drupal)
-   [Row Button](?path=/story/components-row-button--drupal)
-   [Tile Key](?path=/story/components-tile-key--drupal)

### Special mentions

-   Adjust documentation for [Boolean variable](?path=/docs/coding-standards--page#boolean-variable) in Coding Standards docs.

### Components

-   A lot of components has been updated to reflect the right way to code `boolean` variables.

-   Rollback of a part of a CSS modification done in the last release.

#### Price

-   Convert `number` variables to `string`. These numbers in Drupal data arrive as strings, not numbers.

-   None

### Special mentions

-   Code rewriting on all Twig files on all components for a better readability. No functionality has changed on the components, except for those mentioned in this release changelog.

    -   See the [component docs page](?path=/docs/deprecated-ui-kit-image-lazy-load--drupal) for more information.

### Components

#### Icon

-   Removal of `components/icon/twig/index-pattern-lab.twig` as it was not used anymore since this [commit](https://github.com/bifrost-vui/bifrost-front-end-library/commit/a8e53ce8471bae219d1c55ac6c704cb7aed3f23d).

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️

-   🛠️ The classes `js-slick-carousel--mobility-list-devices` and `js-slick-carousel--mobility-list-plans` in `projects/front-end-library/src/lib/js/components/slick-carousel.js` are now `js-bf-slick-carousel--mobility-list-devices` and `js-bf-slick-carousel--mobility-list-plans`. This change is necessary because the JavaScript file that controls carousels on Drupal is a file from `marvel-ui-kit` and even if the classes are the same in our file, it is not working. So we have to change the classes in the Drupal `.twig` files to only target them with our Bifröst JavaScript file. This is to be done in **DWN-1599**.
