# Coding Standards

## Twig Official Standards

Taken from [Twig v3 docs](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/coding_standards.html) and adjusted to our needs.
When writing Twig templates, we recommend you to follow these official coding standards.

Use double-quote (`"`) instead of single-quote (`'`) for strings:

```twig
{{ "foo" }}
{{ foo|default("foo") }}
{{ {"foo": "bar"} }}
{% set foo = "foo" %}
```

Put one (and only one) space after the start of a delimiter (`{{`, `{%`, and `{#`) and before the end of a delimiter (`}}`, `%}`, and `#}`):

```twig
{{ foo }}
{# comment #}
{% if foo %}{% endif %}
```

When using the whitespace control character, do not put any spaces between it and the delimiter:

```twig
{{- foo -}}
{#- comment -#}
{%- if foo -%}{%- endif -%}
```

Put one (and only one) space before and after the following operators: comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`), math operators (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`, `//`, `**`), logic operators (`not`, `and`, `or`), `~`, `is`, `in`, and the ternary operator (`?:`):

```twig
{{ 1 + 2 }}
{{ foo ~ bar }}
{{ true ? true : false }}
```

Put one (and only one) space after the `:` sign in hashes and `,` in arrays and hashes:

```twig
{{ [1, 2, 3] }}
{{ {"foo": "bar"} }}
```

Do not put any spaces after an opening parenthesis and before a closing parenthesis in expressions:

```twig
{{ 1 + (2 * 3) }}
```

Do not put any spaces before and after string delimiters:

```twig
{{ "foo" }}
```

Do not put any spaces before and after the following operators: `|`, `.`, `..`, `[]`:

```twig
{{ foo|upper|lower }}
{{ user.name }}
{{ user[name] }}
{% for i in 1..12 %}{% endfor %}
```

Do not put any spaces before and after the parenthesis used for filter and function calls:

```twig
{{ foo|default("foo") }}
{{ range(1..10) }}
```

Do not put any spaces before and after the opening and the closing of arrays and hashes:

```twig
{{ [1, 2, 3] }}
{{ {"foo": "bar"} }}
```

Use lower camel case variable names:

> Normally with Twig, it would be *lower cased and underscored variable names*,
> but because we also have to support Angular, the choice made is to use lower camel case.
> The project was started with this standard, so we will continue to use it.

```twig
{% set foo = "foo" %}
{% set fooBar = "foo" %}
```

Indent your code inside tags (use the same indentation as the one used for the target language of the rendered template):

> In the current project, we use two spaces for indentation.

```twig
{% block foo %}
  {% if true %}
    true
  {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

## Boolean Variable Names

To be able to differenciate normal variables from boolean ones, here's the standards to use.
It is inspired from these two articles:

- https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/34-better-boolean-variable-names/
- https://dev.to/michi/tips-on-naming-boolean-variables-cleaner-code-35ig

```twig
{# Better Boolean Variable Names #}

{# ❌ bad #}
{% set person = true %}
{% set age = true %}
{% set dance = true %}

{# ✅ Prefix with: is, has, can #}
{% set isPerson = true %}
{% set hasAge = true %}
{% set canDance = true %}
```

With this standard, it will be easier to see if a variable has a boolean value and to use them in conditional expressions.

## Conditional Expressions

### Variable `is defined` and has a value

> Within Drupal, it crashes with `boolean` variable. So don't use with `boolean` variable.

```twig
{% set hasContent = contentVar is defined and contentVar is not empty %}
{% if hasContent %}
  ...
{% endif %}
```

### Boolean variable is `true`

To be sure that the value of a boolean variable is *true*, we first apply a `default` filter with a `false` value
in case of the variable being not defined and then we check if the value is the same as `true`.

The result will give us a real `true/false`.

```twig
{% set isDisabled = isDisabled|default(false) is same as(true) %}
{% if isDisabled %}
  ...
{% endif %}
```
