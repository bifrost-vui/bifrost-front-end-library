# UIKIT Migration to Bifrost
UIKit was code into Twig/php. This documentation is for Drupal only.


## Why we migrate component into UIKIT?
There are a few reasons why to want to kill the UIKIT.
The more principal reason is the dead tool it is built on. The UIKIT was built with the tool "Patter Lab", since a few times this open
software has a near dead community. No patch or update has been done for 2 years. The project is stuck at old dependencies
and has some bugs still listed. It becomes a pain to work with it. In terms of production, we will gain more by switching to
where the community got its focus "Storybook".

But why not change Pattern Lab for Storybook into UIKIT you could ask... It's because the software brings his structure and system.
It's kind of the same as changing React for Angular Framework... It's just better, simpler to burn the house and start from fresh.

The problem of Pattern Lab being too old brings another problem on maintainability. The tool is stuck in PHP 5.6.
Meaning, a developer using the UIKIT in a context of PHP newer than 5.6, can't easily run both versions and all other dependencies.
Developing component into the UIKIT without being able to use Pattern Lab is just useless work losing the quality process.
UIKIT is not dockerized and that solution was evaluated but still consider a plan B. Plan A migration is still to kill the UIKIT.

The third reason and the one more related to business was the creation of a Theme by Designers.
UIKIT was deserving: MyAccount Residential, MyAccount Business, and the e.com shopping flow. All those part was built with
the same visual language. But the Theme request means we have to keep things modular, agnostic, and reusable.
In terms of CSS, everything needs to be rebuilt, and we decide to start from scratch.

And with the years, UIKIT has become full of garbage: duplicated components, bad structure, too complicated versioning, etc.

With all that, we decide to start from 0 with Bifr√∂st the new improved front-end library.
