# Breaking change

Change list :

To avoid file duplication, the Interface and illustration folders containing the svg files have been deleted.
To avoid collision, some files had to be renamed Seed details bellow).
The notion illustration and interface is still important even if the physical separation has been removed :
- an illustration icon should preferably display in Large or medium size but can be used in all sizes if needed
- an interface icon should never be used in large format even if it's possible to do so

Every Icon component now comes in 4 sizes : large, medium, small and xsmall. Therefore the zize is now a required argument
The large and the medium Icon are obtained by resizing a 72px version of the SVG. As for the small and the xsmall they use a 24 pixel version of the SVG file.
Note that the 2 SVG size (72 and 24) may not be identical in order to keep making sens in each range of dimension

The color behavior of the filled type icons has been modified to react to the color classes
