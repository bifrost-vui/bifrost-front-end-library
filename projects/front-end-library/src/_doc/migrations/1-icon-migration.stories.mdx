## Breaking changes

### Change list overview :

**File structure :**

The *interface* and *illustration* folders containing the svg files have been removed.

Illustration and Interface component type:
- An illustration type should preferably display in Large or medium size but can be used in all sizes if needed
- An interface icon should never be used in large format even if it's possible to do so

**SVG files**

All SVG file have been updated and now exist in large and small version ( *filename-lg.svg* & *filename-sm.svg*)

Most of the file renaming is transparent since the appropriate size suffixe is taken care of by the component constructor

Some renaming may still cause an issue  (See details bellow)

**The size is now a required argument**

Every Icon component now comes in 4 sizes : large, medium, small and xsmall.
* The large and the medium Icon components are obtained by resizing the 72px version of the SVG.
* The small and the xsmall Icon components use the 24 pixel version of the SVG file.

*Note that the 2 SVG size (72 and 24) may not be identical in order to keep making sens in each range of dimension*

**updated css**

- The color behavior of the filled type icons has been modified to react to the color classes
- the type class is no longer necessary
- the size class is now mandatory

### Icon renaming

Most icons keep the same name so as long as the size is defined the change should be transparent

For those that do change name, refer to the following lists.
