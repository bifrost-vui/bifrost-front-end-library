# Theme

> As of today, we didn't have a chance to develop any theme other than **videotron theme**. But the structure is ready for multiple themes.

<br/>

Bifrost library is build to support multiple themes. By default, the **videotron theme** is used.

To override it, simply add `data-theme='THEME-NAME'` to any HTML tag.
Since themes are based on **CSS variables**, it will apply without any additional code.

```html
<!-- Videotron theme by default. -->

<div data-theme='business'>
    <!-- Business theme -->
</div>
```
**Note:** If the whole website is in a specific theme, just add the `data-theme` property to the `body` HTML.
